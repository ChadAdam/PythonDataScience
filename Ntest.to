Thanks, so I guess it is using differential signaling, which surprises me given the results I obtained.
Are you being facetious?  [Etymology](http://www.answers.com/gypped&amp;r=67).
I'm sure something similar could be done using another language.  Yi uses haskell, VS uses COM or somesuch (not sure, as I haven't extended VS in years), eclipse uses Java... it just wouldn't be 'emacs' without lisp :)
I have as well and I completely agree. Zed is very genuine. Those who can't understand the value of this have much to learn about life and business.

They could invest the money during the time you use it and make money off the investment. That plus the people who will forget might be worth a decent deal of money if they get enough people to sign up for the program.
Yes.
How is the system supposed to differentiate whether an action should affect the entire system? The OS X-/Ubuntu-/Vista UAC-like 'authorize'/'sudo'/'elevate' prompts are the best solution to this I've seen thus far.
This comment reminds me of the *Hitchhiker's Guide* for some reason.
Agreed, ADD and ADHD are made up disfunctions meant to create a practically infinite market for psychiatrist and to make people feel good about themselves in the short term.

No problem.  I've capped several hundred cables, and maybe 3 or 4 have gone bad after the tester passed them.  I'd say your estimated 5% failure rate is slightly high, but not too high.

[Norton Removal Tool](http://service1.symantec.com/SUPPORT/tsgeninfo.nsf/docid/2005033108162039) should do the trick - you may need to manually remove some files after it's done. We have the best luck running it in safe mode. newlinechar

No, it isn't. Flash suppressors are evil too. That's a muzzle brake, which does everything a flash suppressor does, plus reduces recoil so you can shoot faster.

Probably, I wasn't aware that 2.x was available at all yet, although it's not listed as stable. I don't know if gdc supports it yet either.
With Norton, you don't need a virus, the system slowdown comes built-in.  Plus, its firewall guarantees you can't network anything properly, regardless of how much you try to whitelist everything.
I would say that this isn't a major leap in terms of the complexity of the language. You already need to track what scope you're in, so providing triggers based on scope change adds flexibility without much mental overhead.
